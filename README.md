This project was undertaken during a summer studentship with London Medical Schools Medical Research Council (LMS MRC) Computational Cardiac Imaging Group (O'Regan Lab) in summer 2025

Basic outline of project structure: This entire project was building up to a final presentation.

Project title: Classifying Cardiac pehnotypes and predicting cardiac function with deep learning

The goal of this project was to use UK biobank data (48 patients, 100 biomarkers each) to train a model to predict systollic blood pressure. For this 2 approached were taken: conventinoal datascience techniques(linear regression) and deep learning techniques (autoencoder with a linear regression on latent space).
Summary of results: deep learnng provided far superior feature extraction and as a results led us to being able to produce a superior predicton model with clinically interpretable results. 

The most important parts of this project are the model architecture used (regression_autencoder_model.py) a standard MLP. Whilst this program is largely educational, the images generated highlight important clinical relationships. 
The relevant training data is subject to strict data protection (UK biobank) and as such not inclduded. Results are source code can be disseminated legally.
